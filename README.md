# This is my solution to challenge by FrontendMentor: Multi-step Form

### Apart from making sure project looks the same as design files provided by Frontendmentor, I had to make sure users can do the following:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
